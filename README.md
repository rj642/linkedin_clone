# linkedin_clone

Hey there, I'm creating a LinkedIn Clone application which will have most of the linkedin components such as feed, network, add a post, jobs, and notifications as well.
Along with these I'm also planning to add authentication screen via which a user can login and register as well at the same via a proper interface and backend authentication will be mostly be on firebase along with db [Either mongodb or firebase], if using MongoDB then with the help of Python and FastAPI framework I'll write a backend myself.
